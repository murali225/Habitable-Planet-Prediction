# Habitable-Planet-Prediction

Project Goal

*The goal is to develop a machine learning-based prediction model that classifies exoplanets as habitable or non-habitable. 
*This tool will thereby help SpaceX in its long-term objectives of interplanetary exploration and human settlement by providing insights into possibly habitable planets.
*Classify exoplanet data in real time to assist SpaceX in making informed decisions about    target planets for future missions.

Intended Outcomes
• It provides SpaceX with a reliable tool that can study the exoplanet habitability based on planetary and stellar attributes.
• Enhanced decision-making for targeting selected planets for exploration and colonization.
• Make informed decisions and build a better understanding of the characteristics related to exoplanets by improving the accuracy and efficiency of mission planning.________________________________________
Key Milestones and Deliverables

Phase 1 - Data Collection & Feature Selection
• Deliverables: Critical planetary features, such as orbital period, flux, temperature, among others, will be identified, and the exoplanet dataset will be prepared for modeling.
Phase 2 - Model Development & Training
• Deliverables: A trained-to-predict machine learning model will be developed using selected features, such as Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Phase 3 - Testing & Model Evaluation
• Deliverables: Calculations of such evaluation metrics as accuracy, precision, and recall to make sure that model performance is appropriate according to SpaceX standards.
Phase 4 - Deployment & Cloud Integration
•Flask based web application for real-time habitability prediction by publishing on either Heroku or AWS with a user-friendly interface for the mission planners.________________________________________
Technologies & Tools
